# Human Capabilities - Reaction Time Experiments - Dual Colour Variation

## Reaction Time Experiment: 
- The web page shows 2 empty circles and a button
- After clicking 'Start Experiment', the circles will change to a random colour after random time delays
- This repeats until they match colour
- Upon matching colour, you need to press 'space' as quick as you can
- This repeats 10 times then stores your results in a .csv file
